# Design decisions

Locked decisions for LocTT, extracted from the v1 UI planning docs before
those were retired. Keys (`D1`, `Q4`, `CW-3`, …) are preserved so existing
cross-references keep resolving.

**What's here and what isn't.** Decisions whose outcome is visible in the
code are *not* repeated — the code is the record, and duplicating it here
would just create another thing to drift. What survives is the material
that leaves no trace:

1. **Deliberately not built** — the "we decided against X" calls. Nothing
   in the codebase distinguishes these from oversights, so without this
   list someone eventually "fixes" them.
2. **Decided but unbuilt and unticketed** — real decisions that fell out
   of the plan. These need converting to tickets or dropping on purpose.
3. **Superseded** — where the shipped behaviour diverged from the locked
   decision. Recorded so the old decision isn't re-applied.

## 1. Deliberately not built

Each of these is a considered "no". Re-opening any of them is a product
decision, not a bug fix.

### Scope boundaries for v1

| Key | Decision | What not to "fix" |
|---|---|---|
| **Q21** | **No notifications.** | Absence of any notification system is intentional. |
| **Q23** | **English only.** No i18n framework. | Don't add a translation layer speculatively. |
| **Q25** | **No roles or permissions.** | LocTT is single-user-per-machine; there is no authorization model to complete. |
| **Q27** | **No time tracking.** | `estimate` is a planning number, not a timer. |
| **Q29** | **No print stylesheets.** | |
| **Q16** | **Empty states are text-only.** | No illustrations. |
| **B7** | **No workflow preset selector.** The canonical default workflow (CW-10) is the only starting point. | The absence of "choose a template on init" is deliberate. |
| **B8** | **No workspace name field.** Display uses the directory basename. | Grep confirms zero trace of `workspace_name` anywhere — without this row it reads as an oversight. |

### Capabilities kept out of the UI on purpose

| Key | Decision | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **C2** | **`rebuild key index` is CLI-only.** | A recovery operation, not a routine one. Unlike C1, this one stands. |

### Interaction calls that leave no artifact

| Key | Decision |
|---|---|
| **Q4** | **No websockets and no manual refresh button.** Cross-tab freshness is TanStack Query `staleTime` plus focus refetch. |
| **Q6** | **Card layout is visibility + ordering only — no 2D positioning.** |
| **Q7** | **Broken sidebar pins are silently dropped** *and* removed from config on next render. |
| **Q15** | **Sort-only saved views are allowed** (a view need not filter). |
| **Q20** | **Tasks in archived projects stay editable.** Archiving a project is a list-hygiene action, not a freeze. |
| **SV-6** | **Duplicate saved-view names warn, don't block.** |
| **SV-7** | **Built-in filters are not editable in place.** Editing one opens a Create dialog pre-populated from it. |
| **D19** | **Timezone is editable in two places and last-write-wins.** The duplication is intentional, not a bug to consolidate. |
| **D13 / B18** | **No "hide discarded" board toggle** — superseded by per-status filter chips before it was built. |
| **Q1** | **"No default — force picker" is a valid workspace state.** Don't assume a default project always exists. |

## 2. Resolved — scheduled for build

Every item here was decided, then fell out of the plan. **Status column
updated 2026-08-15**: six of the eight are now built. The two that
remain are blocked on UI routes that render stubs, not on any further
decision.

| Key | Decision | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| **D2 / B2** | **Global search** in the header — `text ~ q` DSL, no full-text index. | ✅ **Built** (`216698b`). `GET /api/search`. Exposed two live bugs: body search matched nothing on any surface (no caller supplied `getBody`), and `searchable: false` was ignored. The header box itself still needs the shell. |
| **B5** | **Lossy-content guardrail** — detect constructs WYSIWYG cannot represent, warn, and force source mode for that task. | ✅ **Detection, API field and TipTap nodes built** (`83c5b82`). The banner and mode-forcing need the body editor, which does not exist. |
| **CW-4** | Bulk ops: `bulkLink`, `bulkUnsetField`, CLI `loctt set T-1,T-2 …`, MCP `bulk_update_tasks`. | ✅ **Built** (`b0ef10a`). Four HTTP routes, CLI comma-refs, MCP tool. **`bulkUnsetField` was not needed** — `bulkSetFields` already treats `value: undefined` as a clear; the gap was that no surface could express it, since JSON has no `undefined`. Each surface maps `null → undefined`. |
| **SV-2** | Saved-view editor reachable from list/board/timeline filter bars, sidebar, view pickers, and Settings. | ⛔ **Blocked on UI.** Needs the editor to have entry points to. |
| **SV-3** | Basic mode covers **all** DSL fields, including custom fields and link predicates. | ⛔ **Blocked on UI.** The named dependency is gone: `relationship.*` was replaced wholesale by `has_link()` / `link_count()` (`1a2b77d`), and saved-view queries are now validated before persisting (`6536462`). What remains is the chip builder, and `/settings/$section` is a stub. |
| **SV-4** | Sort rows inline below filter rows, drag-reorderable for sort priority. | ⛔ **Blocked on UI.** |
| **B14** | Relationship rows show each target's live status. | ⛔ **Blocked on UI.** Its dependency is done: `TaskResponse` now carries resolved relationships including each target's live title and status (`e376634`). What remains is the panel, and `/tasks/$key` is a stub. |
| **D17** | Editor mode (WYSIWYG vs source) persists per user via `UserSettings`. | ✅ **Schema built** (`e25b4bc`), alongside CW-17. UI wiring needs the editor. |

## 3. Superseded — do not re-apply

The locked decision no longer matches what shipped.

| Key | Was decided | What shipped |
|---|---|---|
| **Q19** | Relationship symmetry via a **`symmetric: true`** boolean on `RelationshipDef`. | Shipped as **`kind: "symmetric"`** (`packages/contracts/src/workflow.ts:64,126`). The old form is now **actively rejected** — `workflow.ts:110` errors when `inverse` equals `key`. Any doc or fixture still showing `symmetric: true` is a copy-pasteable bug. |
| **CW-17** | `UserSettings.card_layout` as an **ordered array** (visibility + order). | **Resolved — now implemented.** Was ticked done while only the older boolean-map shape existed in a test fixture. See §5. |
| **CW-20** | Frontend compresses **all** attachment uploads to JPG/WebP. | Narrowed to **avatars only**. |
| **Q24** | Three responsive breakpoints — desktop, tablet, phone — **from day one**. | Phone breakpoint deferred. |
| **Q26** | Comments with **1-level threading**, `@mentions`, and a "Mentions me" filter. | Threading dropped. Note that comments reach **no surface at all** today — the storage layer exists with zero callers. |
| **Q11** | No per-file attachment cap. | A size cap is enforced server-side. |

## 4. Still-binding invariants

Moved to **[invariants.md](invariants.md)** — different audience and
lifecycle. Decisions are history; invariants are rules you check a change
against.

---

## 5. Recently resolved

| Key | Resolution |
|---|---|
| **C1** | **Migration is no longer CLI-only.** The UI gets `POST /api/migrate` and a working "Migrate now" button on the schema banner, gated behind a preview-then-confirm flow showing what will change, how many files, and where the backup lands. MCP gains a migrate tool so agents are not stuck either. The "migration is CLI-only" comment in `packages/contracts/src/service.ts` is now wrong and must be updated when this lands. |
| **CW-17** | **`card_layout` is an ordered array** — `[priority, assignee, due_date]` — carrying visibility *and* order, satisfying Q6's drag-to-reorder. Now defined in `UserSettingsSchema` with contract tests. |
