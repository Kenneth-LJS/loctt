# Design decisions

Locked decisions for LocTT, extracted from the v1 UI planning docs before
those were retired. Keys (`D1`, `Q4`, `CW-3`, …) are preserved so existing
cross-references keep resolving.

**What's here and what isn't.** Decisions whose outcome is visible in the
code are *not* repeated — the code is the record, and duplicating it here
would just create another thing to drift. What survives is the material
that leaves no trace:

1. **Deliberately not built** — the "we decided against X" calls. Nothing
   in the codebase distinguishes these from oversights, so without this
   list someone eventually "fixes" them.
2. **Decided but unbuilt and unticketed** — real decisions that fell out
   of the plan. These need converting to tickets or dropping on purpose.
3. **Superseded** — where the shipped behaviour diverged from the locked
   decision. Recorded so the old decision isn't re-applied.

---

## 1. Deliberately not built

Each of these is a considered "no". Re-opening any of them is a product
decision, not a bug fix.

### Scope boundaries for v1

| Key | Decision | What not to "fix" |
|---|---|---|
| **Q21** | **No notifications.** | Absence of any notification system is intentional. |
| **Q23** | **English only.** No i18n framework. | Don't add a translation layer speculatively. |
| **Q25** | **No roles or permissions.** | LocTT is single-user-per-machine; there is no authorization model to complete. |
| **Q27** | **No time tracking.** | `estimate` is a planning number, not a timer. |
| **Q29** | **No print stylesheets.** | |
| **Q16** | **Empty states are text-only.** | No illustrations. |
| **B7** | **No workflow preset selector.** The canonical default workflow (CW-10) is the only starting point. | The absence of "choose a template on init" is deliberate. |
| **B8** | **No workspace name field.** Display uses the directory basename. | Grep confirms zero trace of `workspace_name` anywhere — without this row it reads as an oversight. |

### Capabilities kept out of the UI on purpose

| Key | Decision | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **C2** | **`rebuild key index` is CLI-only.** | A recovery operation, not a routine one. Unlike C1, this one stands. |

### Interaction calls that leave no artifact

| Key | Decision |
|---|---|
| **Q4** | **No websockets and no manual refresh button.** Cross-tab freshness is TanStack Query `staleTime` plus focus refetch. |
| **Q6** | **Card layout is visibility + ordering only — no 2D positioning.** |
| **Q7** | **Broken sidebar pins are silently dropped** *and* removed from config on next render. |
| **Q15** | **Sort-only saved views are allowed** (a view need not filter). |
| **Q20** | **Tasks in archived projects stay editable.** Archiving a project is a list-hygiene action, not a freeze. |
| **SV-6** | **Duplicate saved-view names warn, don't block.** |
| **SV-7** | **Built-in filters are not editable in place.** Editing one opens a Create dialog pre-populated from it. |
| **D19** | **Timezone is editable in two places and last-write-wins.** The duplication is intentional, not a bug to consolidate. |
| **D13 / B18** | **No "hide discarded" board toggle** — superseded by per-status filter chips before it was built. |
| **Q1** | **"No default — force picker" is a valid workspace state.** Don't assume a default project always exists. |

## 2. Resolved — scheduled for build

Every item here was decided, then fell out of the plan. **Status column
updated 2026-08-15**: six of the eight are now built. The two that
remain are blocked on UI routes that render stubs, not on any further
decision.

| Key | Decision | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| **D2 / B2** | **Global search** in the header — `text ~ q` DSL, no full-text index. | ✅ **Built** (`216698b`). `GET /api/search`. Exposed two live bugs: body search matched nothing on any surface (no caller supplied `getBody`), and `searchable: false` was ignored. The header box itself still needs the shell. |
| **B5** | **Lossy-content guardrail** — detect constructs WYSIWYG cannot represent, warn, and force source mode for that task. | ✅ **Detection, API field and TipTap nodes built** (`83c5b82`). The banner and mode-forcing need the body editor, which does not exist. |
| **CW-4** | Bulk ops: `bulkLink`, `bulkUnsetField`, CLI `loctt set T-1,T-2 …`, MCP `bulk_update_tasks`. | ✅ **Built** (`b0ef10a`). Four HTTP routes, CLI comma-refs, MCP tool. **`bulkUnsetField` was not needed** — `bulkSetFields` already treats `value: undefined` as a clear; the gap was that no surface could express it, since JSON has no `undefined`. Each surface maps `null → undefined`. |
| **SV-2** | Saved-view editor reachable from list/board/timeline filter bars, sidebar, view pickers, and Settings. | ⛔ **Blocked on UI.** Needs the editor to have entry points to. |
| **SV-3** | Basic mode covers **all** DSL fields, including custom fields and link predicates. | ⛔ **Blocked on UI.** The named dependency is gone: `relationship.*` was replaced wholesale by `has_link()` / `link_count()` (`1a2b77d`), and saved-view queries are now validated before persisting (`6536462`). What remains is the chip builder, and `/settings/$section` is a stub. |
| **SV-4** | Sort rows inline below filter rows, drag-reorderable for sort priority. | ⛔ **Blocked on UI.** |
| **B14** | Relationship rows show each target's live status. | ⛔ **Blocked on UI.** Its dependency is done: `TaskResponse` now carries resolved relationships including each target's live title and status (`e376634`). What remains is the panel, and `/tasks/$key` is a stub. |
| **D17** | Editor mode (WYSIWYG vs source) persists per user via `UserSettings`. | ✅ **Schema built** (`e25b4bc`), alongside CW-17. UI wiring needs the editor. |

## 3. Superseded — do not re-apply

The locked decision no longer matches what shipped.

| Key | Was decided | What shipped |
|---|---|---|
| **Q19** | Relationship symmetry via a **`symmetric: true`** boolean on `RelationshipDef`. | Shipped as **`kind: "symmetric"`** (`packages/contracts/src/workflow.ts:64,126`). The old form is now **actively rejected** — `workflow.ts:110` errors when `inverse` equals `key`. Any doc or fixture still showing `symmetric: true` is a copy-pasteable bug. |
| **CW-17** | `UserSettings.card_layout` as an **ordered array** (visibility + order). | **Resolved — now implemented.** Was ticked done while only the older boolean-map shape existed in a test fixture. See §5. |
| **CW-20** | Frontend compresses **all** attachment uploads to JPG/WebP. | Narrowed to **avatars only**. |
| **Q24** | Three responsive breakpoints — desktop, tablet, phone — **from day one**. | Phone breakpoint deferred. |
| **Q26** | Comments with **1-level threading**, `@mentions`, and a "Mentions me" filter. | Threading dropped. Note that comments reach **no surface at all** today — the storage layer exists with zero callers. |
| **Q11** | No per-file attachment cap. | A size cap is enforced server-side. |

## 4. Still-binding invariants

Moved to **[invariants.md](invariants.md)** — different audience and
lifecycle. Decisions are history; invariants are rules you check a change
against.

---

## 5. Recently resolved

| Key | Resolution |
|---|---|
| **C1** | **Migration is no longer CLI-only.** The UI gets `POST /api/migrate` and a working "Migrate now" button on the schema banner, gated behind a preview-then-confirm flow showing what will change, how many files, and where the backup lands. MCP gains a migrate tool so agents are not stuck either. The "migration is CLI-only" comment in `packages/contracts/src/service.ts` is now wrong and must be updated when this lands. |
| **CW-17** | **`card_layout` is an ordered array** — `[priority, assignee, due_date]` — carrying visibility *and* order, satisfying Q6's drag-to-reorder. Now defined in `UserSettingsSchema` with contract tests. |

## 6. Git-sync merge semantics (decided and built 2026-08-15)

Sync used to abort on any file changed on both sides since the last sync.
Nothing was lost, but two clones that each created a task could not merge
at all — they both bump `state.yaml`, so sync stopped before task files
were even compared. That was why `rekeyCollisions` had no caller: no
merged task set existed for it to scan. It is called now, from the
normalise pass in `publish-sync.ts`.

These decisions define what replaces the blanket abort. **All four are
built** (`packages/core/src/git/merge.ts`, `resolve-conflicts.ts`, and
the normalise pass in `publish-sync.ts`).

The four file-type rules approved alongside them, now implemented:

| File | Rule |
|---|---|
| `_history.yaml` | Union on `(timestamp, kind, actor, field)`. Content is deliberately not part of the identity — re-serialization changes formatting, which would duplicate entries. |
| `_comments.yaml` | Union by comment id. **A deletion beats a concurrent edit**: someone removed it deliberately, and the text is still recoverable from history (M3) if that was the mistake. |
| `projects.yaml` / `queries.yaml` | Union by entry id. Projects additionally get provisional prefixes where two collide, *before* writing — `ProjectsConfigSchema` rejects a duplicate on read, so an invalid file could never be loaded to repair. |
| `state.yaml` | Not unioned. Counters are derived from the merged task set per M1. |

**Anything without a rule still aborts**, naming the path —
`workflow.yaml` most notably, because unioning two divergent status
vocabularies could leave tasks pointing at a status the merged config
does not define.

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **M1** ✅ | **Key counters are not merged arithmetically.** After a merge, collect the tasks that exist, renumber only those whose keys collide — ordered by `created_at`, ULID `id` breaking ties — and derive the counter from the result. | Merging counters by `max` under-reserves: base 5, A creates 3, B creates 8 gives 11 new tasks but a counter of 13, so the rekey pass reissues keys that already exist. Deriving from the tasks cannot disagree with what is on disk, and needs no base commit. Non-colliding keys are left alone — renumbering a key someone already referenced is gratuitous churn. |
| **M2** 🔵 | **A contested frontmatter field should be resolved per field, not per record.** Whole-record last-write-wins drops an uncontested field because a *different* field was contested — the common case when two people work one task. Frontmatter has no per-field timestamps (`updated_at` is stamped per write), but **history does**: `field_change` / `custom_field_change` name their field and carry `before`/`after`, `created` carries the whole initial frontmatter (M3), and `_history.yaml` is unioned on merge. Where a field cannot be resolved from history it falls back to whole-record recency **for that field alone**, recording a `merge_resolved` entry naming the field, both values and the side taken, so the fallback is auditable. **Not yet implemented — see the open problem below.** | Shipped behaviour today is whole-record LWW (`merge.ts` `mergeTask`), which is what the rationale for M3 already assumed was not the case. Clock skew can still order two edits wrongly: accepted as a nuisance, not a loss, as before — both values remain in history. |
| **M3** ✅ | **Every history entry records enough to reconstruct the state it changed.** Not just `body_edited` — `created` carries the initial frontmatter and body; `body_edited` carries before/after body (one snapshot per coalesced burst, not per keystroke); `comment_added`/`_edited`/`_deleted` carry the comment text. `archived`/`unarchived` are exempt: the kind fully describes the transition. | Today only `field_change`, `custom_field_change`, and the link/attachment kinds record content. The rest store a timestamp and nothing else, so history says *that* something happened and never *what it was*. This is the prerequisite for M2 — without it "history is the recovery path" is false. `comment_deleted` is the sharpest case: a hard delete with no record of the text, unrecoverable by any means. Independently this is what makes a body diff in the activity feed, and version restore, possible at all. |
| **M4** ✅ | **The body is last-write-wins for the live value, but the losing version is written to a sibling file** rather than silently dropped. | Even with M3, silently replacing someone's paragraphs is a bad experience — they may not notice for days, and history is a place you have to think to look. The body is the field where not noticing costs most. |

**Size, decided:** recording content makes `_history.yaml` grow with
content rather than event count, and it is read in full on every append
and every activity-feed render. Accepted as-is for now — bodies are
usually small and git compresses them well. **Capping the snapshot was
rejected**: a truncated entry cannot reconstruct, which is the guarantee
being added. If it bites, the escape hatch is splitting content into
`_history/<entry-id>.yaml` loaded on demand, keeping the feed fast and
reconstruction exact.

### M2's open problem: history does not see hand-edits

An attempt at the above was reverted, because "the latest history entry
naming the field wins" is wrong on its own:

- **History records structured writes only.** A task edited by hand on
  disk — legitimate, LocTT is file-first — writes no entry. So a rule
  that trusts history silently discards hand-edits in favour of the last
  value some tool wrote, which can be arbitrarily old.
- **Excluding `created` does not help.** It carries the initial
  frontmatter (M3), so a field never edited since creation *is*
  explained by it — but treating it as evidence means a hand-edit loses
  to the birth value, which is worse than the bug being fixed.

Both readings were tried; each breaks a different case. The rule needs
**two** signals, not one: history says what the last structured write
set, and comparing each side's frontmatter against that tells you
whether that side was hand-edited since. Roughly:

| Local vs its history | Incoming vs its history | Take |
|---|---|---|
| matches | matches | later history entry for the field |
| diverges (hand-edit) | matches | local |
| matches | diverges (hand-edit) | incoming |
| diverges | diverges | whole-record recency + `merge_resolved` |

Not implemented. The table is a sketch and has not been checked against
the merge tests, three-way's base tree (which may make the hand-edit
detection cheaper), or the case where one side's `_history.yaml` is
itself missing.

**Not a decision, recorded because it was checked:** history coalescing
is already actor-scoped (`coalesceHistory` compares `last.actor ===
next.actor`) and tested. A burst only collapses within one user's own
edits; two users' edits never merge into one entry.
